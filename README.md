This open source library when completed will be part of a new platform that will let people reclaim, secure and monetise their data. Here from co-founder Nick Gatland at the event on the trUUth mission that is being led by the team from locii innovations and its collaborators across the globe.


## trUUth challenge 1  : Document capture & trim (document scanner)
 
You will create as a flutter library that can be used by any app that is looking to capture a document such as a letter, bill (e.g. telephone bill), page of a legal document etc
 
### Use case stories :
* As a user I am able to point my camera at a document and the camera will auto detect the document edges and create an image of that document only by stripping away any background image captured in the original camera frame
* The system will save the document as ? and save ?
